# scRNAseq - MISTRG -

## Getting Started

Raw datasets are in GSEXXXX. Raw matrices can be downloaded in the data folder.   

### Prerequisites

Need R (3.5.2 or newer) and several packages (`Seurat` and `tidyverse`)


## Deployment

There are three scripts in the Rscripts folder.  

* 1- __UMAP_BM-Liver-Lung-Tumor.R__: corresponding to the analysis of the MISTRG tissues (Bone marrow, Liver, Lung and Tumor)  

* 2- __UMAP_Tumor.R__: corresponding to the analysis of the MISTRG tumor  

* 3- __UMAP-Monocytes-DCs_BM-Liver-Lung-Tumor.R__: corresponding to the analysis of the MISTRG tissues with a focus on monocytes & DCs (Bone marrow, Liver, Lung and Tumor)
